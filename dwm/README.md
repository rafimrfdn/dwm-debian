Welcome to my DWM Setup
=======================

This is my very first DWM 6.2 newest build. Very simple and works well for my workflow.


Features
--------

The cool feature on this DWM setup is created with solid patches. I explore some patches and I think only this 6 pathes works great on my workflow.

Patches in this DWM
-------------------

- Autostart           // use to make autostart.sh file run after DWM first start on system
- Warp                // make mouse always follows the focus screen
- Fullgaps            // create gaps between opened window and can be toggled
- Systray             // I use this to set tray before the dwmbloks (date status)
- Pertag              // use this to make different tag mode for every tag. Ex: [1] set to Floating, but in [2] can set to Monocle
- Alwayscenter        // make floating window always in center of the screen

Keybinds
--------

There is no fancy binding, I make default DWM keybind to keep DWM as it is.

Only change for `mod` key set to `windows` key.

Dependencies apps
-----------------

Some apps might have to install to make `config.h` file works well, such as:
- xbacklight
- pamixer
- rofi
- feh
- reshift
- scrot
- copyq
- kitty
- arandr
- nemo 
- brave
- picom

How to setup this DWM build
---------------------------

This is important thing to do 
1. To make transparent effect, you can set `picom.conf` which is include in this build
2. Create symbolic link of `autostart.sh` file on `~/.local/share/dwm/`
   - `cd ~/.local/share/dwm/`
   - `ln -s path/to/autostart.sh autostart.sh`

dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
